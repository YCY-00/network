If cwnd increases abnormally, it monopolizes network resources and reduces the bandwidth of others, which causes frequent congestion and lowers the overall network performance.
If many users adopt this strategy, the bandwidth can't be allocated fairly, which increases network congestion and reduces network performance. This can lead to regulations such as traffic capping.
