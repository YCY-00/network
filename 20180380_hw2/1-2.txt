If a higher ACK number is sent, the server can detect manipulation by noticing an unusually steep increase in cwnd or by comparing the ACK number to the number of segments actually transmitted.
Corrupt TCP skips lost segments, which can lead to problems such as segments being received out of order or incorrectly received data not being corrected. It means reliability can't be guaranteed.
Modern TCP stacks use SACK to include information about the received segment in the ACK. This alleviates the problem by letting the sender know which segments were actually received.
